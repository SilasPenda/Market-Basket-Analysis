# Market-Basket-Analysis
This is an analysis using an online store data to gain insights on items frequently purchased together and be able to recommend products to customers. also predict the probability of a customer purchasing an item if her buys a certain item.
## Project Guide
In this project i made use of pandas, numpy, mlxtend(apriori and association_rules)
## Acheivements
* In this project i was able to gain insights on customers based on locations (particularly German and Dutch customers) by narrowing down the dataset to those locations.
* I was also able to create an itemset for most frequently bought items using 'apriori' algorithm from the mlxtend library
* I was able to create set rules to predicts the probability of a customer to purchase an item (i.e the probability of a customer to purchase bread) and the probability of the customer to buy another item (i.e the probability of a cutomer to purchase butter if her purchases bread) by using the 'association_rules' algorithm from mlxtend library.
