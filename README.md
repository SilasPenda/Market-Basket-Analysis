## Acheivements
* In this project i was able to gain insights on customers based on locations (particularly German and Dutch customers) by narrowing down the dataset to those locations.
* Created an itemset for most frequently bought items using 'apriori' algorithm from the mlxtend library
* Created rules to predicts the probability of a customer to purchase an item (i.e the probability of a customer to purchase bread) and the probability of the customer to buy another item (i.e the probability of a customer to purchase butter if her purchases bread) by using the 'association_rules' algorithm from mlxtend library.
